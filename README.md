This repository provides an implementation of the analysis described in [LePageâ€™s lectures on Lattice QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0506036). The project explores the numerical formulation Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) on a discretized space-time lattice, focusing on Monte Carlo methods, path integrals, and gauge field computations.
